  <h1>Everyone Looks Fine—Until You Ask.</h1>
  <p>University is supposed to be exciting—but many students are quietly comparing themselves to others and wondering if they belong. Welcome to InsideOut: Student Voices at KU—an initiative to turn silent struggles into open conversations.</p>

<section id="about">
  <h2>👥 About InsideOut</h2>
  <p><strong>Who We Are</strong><br>
    We’re a student-led awareness initiative created from a real technical report conducted at Khalifa University in Spring 2025. InsideOut was born from research, but driven by emotion. It’s a space where KU students can explore the hidden pressures of university life—comparison, confidence, belonging, and mental well-being.</p>
  <p><strong>Our Mission</strong><br>
    To build a campus culture rooted in emotional honesty—not just achievement. We believe that being real is more powerful than being perfect.</p>
  <p><strong>Our Goals:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Normalize open conversations about pressure and self-doubt</li>
    <li>Help students see they’re not alone in feeling behind</li>
    <li>Use storytelling, data, and design to support student wellness</li>
    <li>Shift KU culture from competition to connection</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📚 The Pressure Beneath the Surface</h2>
  <p><strong>Background (Based on Literature Review)</strong><br>
    Khalifa University is known for excellence. But behind that excellence lies a quiet struggle: students comparing themselves to peers in academics, leadership, social life, and even personality. According to social comparison theory, this is natural—but in highly competitive spaces, it becomes harmful.</p>
  <p><strong>Your research shows:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Students often feel like their achievements don’t matter when surrounded by "high performers."</li>
    <li>Upward comparison can decrease confidence, increase anxiety, and even cause imposter syndrome.</li>
    <li>Students who constantly compare themselves feel less connected, avoid social engagement, and hesitate to ask for help.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>The Illusion of Perfection</strong><br>
    When everyone looks put-together, students assume they’re the only ones struggling. But they’re not. That illusion is isolating—and dangerous.</p>
</section>

<section id="findings">
  <h2>📊 What Our Research Revealed</h2>
  <p><strong>Findings From Our KU Student Survey (N = 24)</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔️ <strong>Social Comparison is Frequent:</strong> Most students rated their comparison frequency between 6–9 out of 10.</li>
    <li>✔️ <strong>Confidence Suffers:</strong> 55% said comparison lowered their confidence. Only 5% said it increased it.</li>
    <li>✔️ <strong>Belonging is Affected:</strong> As comparison increased, students were less likely to feel they belonged.</li>
    <li>✔️ <strong>Imposter Syndrome is Real:</strong> 37.5% experience it sometimes, 33% often or always.</li>
    <li>✔️ <strong>The Illusion Has Power:</strong> Students who believe others "have it figured out" are more hesitant to ask for help, engage, or join groups.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Conclusion?</strong><br>
    What students believe about their peers shapes what they do. This illusion causes withdrawal, doubt, and loneliness.</p>

<section id="recommendations">
  <h2>💡 Our Recommendations</h2>
  <p><strong>How can KU reduce this pressure and improve well-being?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>🎙️ Start a student-led podcast — Normalize “figuring it out” as a process.</li>
    <li>🌐 Create a digital confession wall — Real, anonymous stories from KU students.</li>
    <li>🧏‍♀️ Train faculty to recognize burnout signs — Just one kind check-in can shift a student’s entire week.</li>
    <li>☕ Host monthly “circle talks” — Informal, safe, honest, and non-judgmental spaces.</li>
    <li>🎨 Use storytelling in KU events — Highlight growth journeys, not just polished outcomes.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="stories">
  <h2>🗣️ Stories from KU</h2>
  <p>Real voices. Real pressure. Real reflection.</p>
  <div class="story">
    <strong>🎤 “I always thought I was the only one behind. Then I realized most of us are pretending we’re okay.”</strong>
    <p>Many KU students hide their stress behind smiles and strong grades. But our research shows these feelings are common—and that silence is the problem.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="story">
    <strong>🧍 “I stopped going to club meetings because I thought I couldn’t keep up. Everyone seemed so confident. I didn’t realize they were also struggling.”</strong>
  </div>
  <div class="story">
    <strong>😓 “When I got a good grade, I didn’t feel proud. I felt scared. Like now they’ll expect it every time and I’ll eventually mess up.”</strong>
  </div>
  <div class="story">
    <strong>💭 “Social media is full of success stories, but no one posts the nights they cry over failing a quiz. We all have those nights.”</strong>
