  <h2>About InsideOut</h2>
  <p>
    InsideOut is more than a project—it’s a movement. Born from a student’s research project at Khalifa University, InsideOut transforms data and academic insight into real-world awareness. Our mission is to bring hidden struggles into the light and show students that behind every perfect answer is someone quietly asking questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    We aim to build a compassionate student culture where emotional wellness matters as much as academic performance. Through stories, statistics, and shared truth, we’re creating space for students to be real, not just impressive.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="background">
  <h2>The Pressure Beneath the Surface</h2>
  <p>
    Khalifa University students face immense pressure to perform. As our literature review uncovered, comparison culture runs deep. According to Festinger’s Social Comparison Theory, people evaluate themselves by comparing to others—especially in competitive environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    This results in students feeling inadequate even when they’re succeeding. The "Big Fish–Little Pond Effect" also plays a role: when surrounded by high achievers, students begin to question their own value. Over time, this lowers confidence, reduces classroom engagement, and weakens the feeling of community.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="findings">
  <h2>Key Findings</h2>
  <p>
    We surveyed 24 KU students and identified several consistent themes across experiences:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Comparison is Common:</strong> Most rated their comparison frequency between 6 and 9 out of 10.</li>
    <li><strong>Confidence Declines:</strong> 80% said frequent comparison lowered their self-esteem.</li>
    <li><strong>Belonging Suffers:</strong> Students who compare themselves more felt more isolated from the KU community.</li>
    <li><strong>Imposter Syndrome:</strong> Over 70% reported feeling like they didn’t deserve their achievements at least sometimes.</li>
    <li><strong>Illusion of Perfection:</strong> Many believed peers had life figured out while they struggled in silence.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The effects are emotional—but they also affect behavior. Students who feel lesser are less likely to speak up, seek help, or get involved in campus life.
  </p>

<section id="recommendations">
  <h2>Our Recommendations</h2>
  <p>
    Change begins with awareness, but it continues through action. Based on our findings, here’s what we believe KU can do:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>🎙️ Launch a podcast hosted by students discussing personal stories of failure, growth, and mental health.</li>
    <li>📝 Create an anonymous online wall where students can share their honest struggles and advice.</li>
    <li>☕ Set up monthly small-group support sessions to discuss issues openly in a safe, peer-led space.</li>
    <li>📣 Train academic staff to recognize signs of emotional exhaustion and normalize vulnerability in classrooms.</li>
    <li>🎨 Host storytelling nights or art exhibits focused on inner struggles and self-expression.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="stories">
  <h2>Stories from KU</h2>
  <p>These reflective stories are inspired by real student insights and patterns we found in our data:</p>
  <div class="story">
    <strong>"I never feel enough—even when I succeed."</strong>
    <p>People see my GPA and assume I’m fine. But inside, I feel like I’ve tricked everyone. Success doesn’t silence the voice in my head saying I don’t deserve it—it makes it louder.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="story">
    <strong>"Everyone seems ahead. I just try to keep up."</strong>
    <p>At KU, it feels like everyone has a startup, a scholarship, or some amazing passion. I just try to get through each day. When I compare, I feel like I’m falling behind in life.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="story">
    <strong>"Sometimes I feel like a ghost on campus."</strong>
    <p>I stopped going to events because I felt invisible. Everyone looked like they belonged—confident, connected, capable. I didn’t want to stand out, so I started disappearing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="story">
    <strong>"Social media is a highlight reel—I’m living the bloopers."</strong>
    <p>It’s exhausting pretending everything is okay. Online, everyone’s glowing. Offline, I’m exhausted. I realized we’re all curating our lives while quietly drowning.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="solutions">
  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    What happens when confidence drops, and nobody talks about it? Students stop showing up. They pull away from opportunities, avoid new people, and internalize failure.
  </p>
  <p>
    But connection is the cure. InsideOut believes in the power of shared stories to heal invisible wounds. One honest voice can spark a wave of belonging.
